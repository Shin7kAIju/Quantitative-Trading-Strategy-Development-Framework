### 4. Walk Forward Permutation Test
   - **Purpose**: Similar to the in-sample permutation test, this step assesses whether the strategy's out-of-sample (walk forward) performance is statistically significant or could be due to randomness.
   - **Process**:
     - Take the out-of-sample results from the walk forward test and perform a permutation test on them.
     - Randomize the out-of-sample data (e.g., shuffle returns or price movements) and rerun the strategy to generate a distribution of possible outcomes.
     - Compare the actual out-of-sample performance to this distribution to determine if it’s statistically significant (e.g., p-value < 0.05).
   - **Outcome**: This step ensures that the strategy’s performance in the walk forward test isn’t just a fluke or the result of random market noise, providing confidence in its reliability for live trading.
