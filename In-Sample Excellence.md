### 1. In-Sample Excellence
   - **Purpose**: This is the initial step where you develop and optimize your trading strategy using historical data, known as the "in-sample" dataset. The goal is to create a strategy that performs well on this data.
   - **Process**:
     - Select a historical dataset (e.g., price data for a stock, currency pair, or index) covering a specific time period.
     - Define the trading strategy, which could include rules based on technical indicators (e.g., moving averages, RSI, MACD), price patterns, or other quantitative signals.
     - Optimize the strategy parameters (e.g., lookback periods, thresholds) to maximize performance metrics like Sharpe ratio, return, or win rate on the in-sample data.
     - Ensure the strategy shows "excellence" by demonstrating strong profitability, low drawdowns, and consistency within this dataset.
   - **Caution**: Be careful of overfittingâ€”tuning the strategy too much to the in-sample data can make it perform poorly on new data. This is why subsequent steps are critical.

### Step 1: In-Sample Excellence
**Goal**: Develop and optimize a trading strategy on historical in-sample data to achieve strong performance.

**Detailed Process**:
1. **Gather Data**:
   - Load historical price data for your asset (e.g., 5 years of daily data for a stock like AAPL).
   - Example in Python:
     ```python
     import pandas as pd
     import yfinance as yf

     # Download data
     ticker = "AAPL"
     start_date = "2018-01-01"
     end_date = "2023-01-01"
     data = yf.download(ticker, start=start_date, end=end_date)
     data = data[['Close']]  # Use closing prices
     ```
